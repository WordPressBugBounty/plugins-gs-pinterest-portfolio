= How to use Shortcodes in Page Templates? =
WordPress's extensive functionality makes it an excellent choice for website development. One of its most useful features is the **do_shortcode()** function, which allows you to use shortcodes within your theme files. For example, you can use this function to display Portfolios directly in a theme file. Here’s how to do it.

`
<?php echo do_shortcode('[gs_pinterest id=1]'); ?>
`

= How to overwrite Templates in the GS Pinterest Portfolio Plugin? =
To customize templates in the GS Pinterest Portfolio plugin:

- **Locate Templates**: Find them in **gs-pinterest-portfolio-pro/templates**.
- **Create a Custom Folder**: In your active theme’s directory, create **gs-pinterest**.
- **Override Templates**: Copy the template file you want to modify (e.g., **gs_pinterest_user_profile.php**) from the plugin folder to the **gs-pinterest** folder in your theme: **/wp-content/themes/yourtheme/gs-pinterest/gs_pinterest_user_profile.php**.
- **Make Changes**: Edit the copied file in your theme’s directory.

This allows you to customize the plugin without changing the core files, ensuring your changes persist through updates.

For a detailed guide, check out Pinterest Plugin’s [template override](https://docs.gsplugins.com/gs-pinterest-portfolio/faq/#how-to-overwrite-templates-in-the-gs-pinterest-portfolio-plugin) documentation.

= Is there a Widget to display Pins? =
Yes, the plugin offers four distinct widgets for various functionalities. Here are their names:

- GS Pinterest Follow Button
- GS Pinterest Pin Widget (for a single pin)
- GS Pinterest Boards Widget
- GS Pinterest Profile Widget

To use these widgets, simply drag and drop them into your desired widget area. Follow the provided instructions to configure each Pinterest widget accordingly.

= Why are my latest pins not visible on my website? =
The Pinterest Pinboard Widget updates its cache every 15 minutes to boost loading speeds. New pins might not appear instantly due to this update delay, so please be patient as the feed refreshes.

= How do I show Pins from specific boards? =
Showing pins from specific boards is easy. To display pins from a particular board, simply enter the board name in the plugin’s designated input field. For the correct format, check the URL following the username. 

For example, if your board URL is *https://www.pinterest.com/jonathan/fathers-day/*, enter **jonathan** in the username box and **fathers-day** in the board name field. This will ensure only pins from that board are shown.

= Is it possible to create a Pinterest sub-board? =
The sub-board feature is currently unavailable, but we have plans to add it in the future. We are in the process of applying for Pinterest's API to enable the sub-board functionality and are awaiting approval. At present, we have limited control over pins displayed through the RSS feed.

= I downloaded the plugin, and I can’t seem to get my Pinterest feed to display on my website. =
After installing the plugin, navigate to its settings and enter your Pinterest username. Then, generate a shortcode to display pins in your desired locations on your site.
